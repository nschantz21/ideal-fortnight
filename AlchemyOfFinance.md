## Reflexivity in the Stock Market
Focus on discrepancy between participant expectations and the actual course of events as a causal factor in that process.

What were the expectations for a period?
What actually transpired over the period?
What was the reaction to the spread in the next period?

Price should imply expected earnings growth.
Actual earnings growth can then be observed.
The spread is then calculated.
The next period of stock price movement should be viewed in light of this spread.

**Prevailing Bias**
In the stock market the participants' bias finds expression in purchases and sales.  
**There may be something in market depth - buy/sell pressures**
A positive bias leads to rising stock prices and a negative one to falling prices. Thus the prevailing bias is an observable one.  

**Underlying Trend**
influences the movement of stock prices whether it is recognized by the investors or not.

The underlying trend influences the participants' perceptions though the cognitive function; the resulting change in perceptions affects the situation through the participating function. In the case of the stock market, the primary impact is on stock prices. The change in stock prices may, in turn, affect both the participants' bias and the underlying trend.

So it's kinda the momentum of the bias.

The trend in stock prices can then be envisioned as a composite of the "underlying trend" and the "prevailing bias"

When Stock Prices reinforce the underlying trend or the perceived bias, we shall call them self-reinforcing or self-correcting. When a trend is reinforced, it accelerates. When the bias is reinforced, the divergence between expectations and the actual course of future stock prices gets wider and conversely when it is self-correcting, the divergence gets narrower.



The underlying trend is some fundamental measure, like EPS.
The underlying trend can be a combination of fundamental measures given different weights.
The prevailing bias is partially incorporated in the two curves and partially denoted by the divergence between them.

Bias can reinforce price, but without change in fundamentals it should reverse,

Steps
1. Unrecognized Trend
2. Beginning of a self-reinforcing process
3. successful test
4. growing conviction, resulting in widening divergence between reality and expectations
5. flaw in perceptions
6. climax
7. reversal

**Q:** Can stock prices actually affect underlying trend though?
The book mentions earnings growth through M&A - which I guess could be facilitated by stock price (market cap) growth.

The larger picture is full of reflexive interactions as well as nonreflexive fundamental trends. we need a more complex model that allows for the transition from one boom/bust sequence to another and for the coexistence of several reflexive processes at the same time.
