# Standards of Value
1. Fair Market Value
2. **Investment Value**
3. Intrinsic Value
4. Fair Value (state rights)
5. Fair Value (financial reporting)

### Premises of Value
* Value in exchange
* Value to the holder

> Investment value can be measured, for example, as the discounted net cash flow that a particular investor would expect a company to earn, in the way that particular (owner) investor would operate it.

### Intrinsic value

> Intrinsic value and investment value may seem like similar concepts, but they differ in that intrinsic value represents an estimate of value based on the perceived characteristics adhering to the investment itself, while investment value is more reliant on characteristics adhering to a particular purchaser or owner

## Fair alue in Financial Accounting
Look at Financial Accounting Standards Board definitions of fair value and framework for measuring fair value in GAAP.

You can categorize the inputs to valuation. This could give you levels of confidence on your qualitative inputs.
SFAS 157 (now ASC 820) establishes a fair value measurement hierarchy, which relates to a preference for using observable market data in measuring fair value, when market data are available.
**Level 1** inputs are observable market inputs that reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.   
**Level 2** inputs are observable market inputs but for assets that are similar but not identical. Assets that will typically be valued using Level 1 and Level 2 estimates are financial instruments. Examples of financial instruments include investments such as marketable securities.  
**Level 3** inputs are unobservable market inputs and may consider assumptions about market participant inputs that are estimated by the management of an entity. However, management assumptions should not include factors specific to that entity if such factors do not also reflect the assumptions of market participants. For business combination purposes, the valuation of most nonfinancial assets often uses Level 3 inputs.

# Research and Its Presentation

## Internal Information
Company filings

## External Information
Following the outline of Revenue Ruling 59-60, most external data used in a
closely held company valuation falls into three areas:
1. Economic Data. Economic data includes information on national economic conditions and local market conditions. It encompasses the entire macroeconomic environment, including demographic and social trends, technological issues, and the political/regulatory environment.
2. Industry Data. Industry data should focus on the competitive structure of the industry and its prospects for growth. The relative position or market share of the subject company in the market area and the subject company’s financial performance as compared to industry standards are important considerations.
3. Guideline Publicly Traded Company and Guideline Company Transaction Data. Guideline information, if available, can be important to understanding the subject company’s relative performance. Collecting guideline information involves identifying companies similar to the subject company, locating pricing and financial data, and identifying, if appropriate, transactions involving the sales of controlling interests in similar companies.

## Information Search
It would be beneficial to document and refine the information gathering process.  
Part of this is how the search was conducted. Linking documents to search methods. Linking information to documents.
Quality of documents and information.
## Information Organization
Broadly categorized as company specific, Industry. Macro economic, Micro Economic  

## Economic
Issues to consider when analyzing a local economy include:
* Whether the local economy is dependent on a single employer or industr
* The extent and condition of the area’s infrastructure
* Announcements of major plant openings or closings
*  Income levels and poverty rates
* Attitudes of local officials toward attracting new employers
*  Population growth

### Industry
These questions can help in the preparation of an
industry analysis:

* What are the prospects for growth? 
* What are the industry’s dominant economic traits? 
* What competitive forces are at work in the industry and how strong are they? 
* What are the drivers of change in the industry and what effect will they have? 
* Which companies are in the strongest/weakest competitive positions? 
* What key factors will determine competitive success or failure? 
* How attractive is the industry in terms of its prospects for above-average profitability? 
* How large is the industry?
* Is the industry dominated by a few large companies?
* Are there many public companies in this industry?
* How much merger and acquisition activity is occurring?
* What are the barriers to entry?
* Is it a regulated industry?
* Who are the customers? Is that base growing

## Presentation
The relevant economic and industry information presented in the report should relate to the valuation conclusion.

# Financial Statement and Company Risk Analysis
 a well-reasoned valuation analysis includes certain critical elements: 
 * An estimation of the amount of future economic benefits (normalization and projection of future cash flows)
* An assessment of the probability or risk that the projected future

The mechanics of the process of financial statement analysis, generally considered to be five steps:
1. Spreading historical financial statements in columnar format
2. Normalizing historical financial statements
3. Common-sizing normalized historical financial statements
4. Performing ratio analysis on the normalized historical financial statements
5. Subjecting normalized historical financial statements to industry comparison

### Historical Financial Statement Analysis
An analysis of five years of historical financial statements is generally considered sufficient to identify trends occurring in the business.

### Financial Statement Adjustments
the historical financial statements may need to be adjusted (modified) for certain items that, in the analyst’s judgment, distort the true operating performance of the business.  

Keep a record of all adjustments and reasoning. How to structure that data?
 * source, target, value, reason - maybe
 * incorrect value
 * Misclassifications
 * 
 
Some potential adjustment reasons
 * To develop historical earnings from which to predict future earnings 
 * To present historical financial information on a normalized basis, that is, under normal operating conditions
 * To adjust for accounting practices that are a departure from industry or GAAP standards
 * To facilitate a comparison of a given company to itself, to other companies within the same industry, or to an accepted industry standard
 * To compare the debt and/or capital structure of the company to that of its competition or peers
* To compare compensation with industry norms
 
#### Normalization of Historical Financial Statements
The objective of normalizing historical financial statements is to present the data on a basis more comparable to that of other companies in the industry, thereby allowing the analyst to form conclusions as to the strength or weakness of the subject company relative to its peers.  
Normalization generally involves adjusting for a number of broad categories:
* Unusual items
* Nonrecurring items
* Extraordinary items (both unusual and nonrecurring, per Accounting Principles Board [APB] Opinion #30)
* Nonoperating items
* Changes in accounting principle
* Nonconformance with GAAP
* Degree of ownership interest, including whether the interest has control

#### Common Sizing Normalized Financial Statements
Common sizing involves expressing each item on the financial statements as a percentage of some base number and is performed on both the normalized balance sheet and the normalized income statement for each period under consideration. On the balance sheet, each item is expressed as a percentage of total assets, and on the income statement, each item is expressed as a percentage of sales.  
Common-sized financial analysis provides insight into the company’s historical operating performance, facilitates an assessment of relationships between and among certain accounts, identifies certain trends or unusual items, and can be used to compare the operating performance of the subject company to its industry or to specific guideline companies. This analysis is sometimes useful before making normalization adjustments in order to identify other potential adjustments, with a second normalization process then conducted.  

#### Ratio Analysis
Time Series Analysis: compare the company’s ratios over a specified historical time period and identifies trends that might indicate financial performance improvement or deterioration  
Cross-sectional Analysis: compare a specified company’s ratios to other companies or to industry standards/norms.  
Try to use year-end values, and never mix end/beginning of year numbers.  

#### Comparative Analysis
For highlighting differences between the subject company’s historical performance and industry averages, pointing out relative operating strengths and weaknesses of the subject company as compared to its peers, assessing management effectiveness, and identifying areas where the company is out performing or underperforming the industry. Comparative analysis is performed by comparing the ratios of the subject company to industry ratios taken from commonly accepted sources of comparative financial data.

#### Risk Analysis
Ratios do not inform the analyst as to why the observed results occurred, knowledge that is important to the understanding of business risk and the general probability that a company’s estimated future economic benefits will be realized.  
##### Qualitative
The disciplines of strategic management and organizational theory provide useful models by which to conduct risk analyses.  

* Porter's Strategy
* McKinsey 7-S Model
* DuPont Model
* SWOT

Try mapping the system by which the company makes money. Show where the company resides in the industry. As a wholesaler, a transaction handler, the producer of raw material, etc.  

#### Macroenvironmental Analysis

Further removed from the subject company than industry forces but still affecting it
significantly are five macroenvironmental sources of risk:
1. Technological risk
2. Sociocultural risk
3. Demographic risk
4. Political risk
5. Global risk

There's a list of common financial ratios. Probably useful to see if we can get all of these.

# Income Approach
The income approach to business valuation embraces a forward-looking premise by calculating value based on the assumption that the value of an ownership interest is equal to the sum of the present values of the expected future benefits of owning that interest.  

Three Methods:
1. Capitalized Cash Flow
2. Discounted Cash Flow
3. Excess Cash Flow

Each method requires the determination of a "future benefit stream", a numerator, and a rate of return (risk), a denominator. The CCF method utilizes just one numerator and denominator, whereas the DCF utilizes a series of fractions. The ECF method is really a hybrid method, combining elements of both the asset and the income approaches.

Assumptions
* real rate of return
* expected inflation
* risk

## Steps
Define Net Cash Flow. Is it Pre or Post Tax? Is it Operating Income?
What is the beneficiary of the Net Cash Flow? Equity or Debt Holders? Controlling/Non-controlling shareholders or both?
Match Characteristics of numerator and denominator (tax and beneficiary).

Determine Valuation Method.
Normalize Financial Information.


## Normalization Process
Items that are not representative of the appropriate future cash flow must be either eliminated or adjusted in some manner. The process begins with the collection of historical financial data and includes a detailed review of that data to determine what, if any, adjustments are required.  

### big five
1. For ownership characteristics (control versus minority)
2. For GAAP departures and extraordinary, nonrecurring, and/or unusual items *
3. For nonoperating assets and liabilities and related income and expenses *
4. For taxes *
5. For synergies from mergers and acquisitions, if applicable

2,3, and 4 are almost always done. 1 is necessary if analyzing a minority interest.

### Net Cash Flow



Use Net Cash Flow as measure of future economic benefit.  
1. Cash flow to the equity shareholders (direct equity method)
2. Cash flow to invested capital  (invested capital method)

DCF or CCF choose one of the cash flow methods.

#### Historical Info
Five commonly used methodologies by which to estimate future economic benefits from historical data:
1. The current earnings method
2. The simple average method
3. The weighted average method
4. The trend line-static method
5. The formal projection method

The fifth method is the basis for the DCF method.  

In the formal projection method, future balance sheets, income statements, and statements of cash flows are created to ensure that all aspects of future cash flows have been addressed and that assumptions utilized in the projection of the income statement work properly through the balance sheet.  

### DCF

#### Terminal Value
There are many ways of determining a terminal growth rate.  
Use Gordon Growth Model.  
Other methods exist.

### ECF
The ECF method can be prepared using either equity or invested capital returns and cash flows.

# Cost of Capital/Rates of Return

The cost of capital for an enterprise represents the economic cost of attracting and retaining capital in a competitive environment where investors carefully analyze and compare all investment opportunities. The cost of capital is also referred to as the discount rate. It equals the total expected rate of return for the investment, that is, dividends or withdrawals, plus expected capital appreciation over the life of the investment. This rate, when applied to the appropriate income or cash flow stream of a company, will give an estimate of the company’s value.

Calculate the cost of capital to get the appropriate discount rate for cash flows.

Three basic components of investor expectations are captured in the cost of capital:
1. The "real" rate of return—the amount that investors expect to obtain in exchange for letting someone else use their money on a risk-less basis
2. Expected inflation—the expected depreciation in purchasing power while the money is tied up
3. Risk—the uncertainty about when and how much cash flow or other economic benefit will be received

## COST-OF-CAPITAL METHODS
Several methods are available to calculate the cost of capital or discount/cap rate for a specific investment. Some of the more common methods include:
* Build-Up Method (BUM)
* Capital asset pricing model (CAPM) method
* Modified capital asset pricing model (MCAPM) method
* Weighted average cost of capital Method (WACC) method
* Price/earnings method

## Quantifying Risk

Used in establishing Cost of Equity (COE).

### Systematic
mostly coefficients to factors

### Unsystematic
pretty much analyst preference
Some useful charts based on Porter's Competitive Strategy.

## DEVELOPMENT OF THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL
To compute a proper cost of capital, it is common first to examine the capital structure of the business entity being valued. Three types of capital form the capital structure of most business entities:

1. Common equity
2. Preferred equity
3. Long-term debt

Each of these components has a cost associated with it. The definition of the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is the blended cost of the company’s capital structure components, each weighted by the market value of that capital component. The use of a WACC method to determine value can be appropriate when the objective is to value the entire capital structure of the enterprise or invested capital, such as in an acquisition where the buyer believes the current capital structure may not be optimal or where he or she intends to change it. In this situation, a WACC can be developed for several capital structure scenarios (more debt, less debt, debt of different types with different rates, etc.) as a way for the buyer to try out different approaches to enterprise financing.

Exhibit 6.24 has definitions of WACC Formula Variables

### Closely Held Company
Because the market values are unknown, an analyst can begin with an initial estimate of market value weights and apply these weights and accompanying estimated costs of capital into the WACC formula. The subsequent WACC that is developed is used to calculate the market value of total invested capital. Subtracting the estimated market value of debt provides the first approximated value of common equity, and accordingly, a second computation of the capital structure weights to be applied. - iterative process

# Market Approach
the value of a business can be determined by reference to sales of reasonably comparable guideline companies (also referred to here as “comparables” or “comps”) that have taken place in either the public or the private marketplace. The value may be known either because the companies are publicly traded or because they were recently sold and the terms of the transaction were disclosed. Based on the economic principle of substitution, a rational financial buyer will not pay more for a company than the current price for a comparable company.

There are three methodologies under the market approach that use transactions as indications of the market value:
1. Guideline Public Company Method—based on reasonably comparable publicly traded companies.
2. Guideline Company Transaction Method—based on transactions of reasonably comparable private companies reported in various databases.
3. Direct Market Data Method (DMDM)—based on a significant number of private transactions reported in various databases that purport to represent the market.

The market approach is the most common approach employed by real estate appraisers, referred to as the sales comparison approach in real estate appraisals.

The analyst may use one or all three of the market methods. Often the availability of information may indicate which methodology can be applied and the level of reliance, if any.

## Basic Implementation
$$ Value_{subject} = \bigg[ \bigg( \frac{Price}{Parameter} \bigg)_{comps} \times Parameter_{subject} \bigg] - Debt_{Subject} $$
"Parameter" might be sales, net income, book value, and the like. The Price/ Parameter multiple is the appropriate pricing multiple based on that parameter (e.g., price/net income, price/book value) and taken from the guideline companies or DMDM data. In some cases (invested capital multiples) the debt of the subject company may have to be subtracted.


Try to use percentiles. Using percentiles rather than simple averages or composites provides a range of values and helps protect the information from the effects of outliers.

## ADJUSTMENTS TO THE GUIDELINE AND SUBJECT COMPANIES
Before actually comparing the companies, some adjustments to the data may have to be made. Publicly traded companies tend to need fewer of these adjustments than privately held firms. To the extent that there are certain accounting changes or nonrecurring events reflected in the companies' numbers, or the companies use different accounting methods, the financial data will need to be adjusted so all company financial data is analyzed on a similar basis.

## CONCLUDING REMARKS ON CHOOSING COMPARABLES
The process for choosing guideline companies can be summarized as:
* Using a variety of data sources, compile a list of companies in the same or similar industry as the subject company.
* Review the detailed business descriptions of these companies and eliminate those that are dissimilar to the business of the subject company.
* Eliminate or adjust the multiples of companies whose financial characteristics are not similar to the subject such as size and growth potential.
* Collect detailed financial information (both historical and prospective, if available) about each of the potential guideline companies, placing the data in a format that is consistent across all companies, and include the same information for the subject company.
* Make any necessary adjustments to the guideline companies and the subject company.

MVIC and MVEq are chosen as the numerator of the multiple based on the parameter being assessed. p 296 - 297

### Mutliples Adjustment
You can adjust the derived multiples for company earnings growth - like if the company you are comparing it to has drastically different growth rate.  
Adjust for Size.

The final determination of which particular pricing multiple(s) to use must be based on an understanding of how the subject compares to the guideline companies in term of the important factors.

# Asset Approach
A general way of determining a value indication of a business, business ownership interest, or security using one or more methods based on the value of the assets net of liabilities.

The asset approach presents the value of all the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the company. This approach starts with a book basis balance sheet as close as possible to the valuation date and restates the assets and liabilities, including those that are unrecorded, to fair value (financial reporting) or fair market value (tax and other purposes).

With the possible exception of certain financial institutions, a historically based accounting balance sheet will almost always bear little relationship to value. The balance sheet is useful only as a starting point and requires a series of adjustments to reach fair market value. The value indication thus derived may require further adjustments to properly reflect fair market value relative to the specific subject interest. The asset approach is more commonly used in valuations for financial and tax reporting and for asset-intensive businesses.

The asset approach is typically used to value investment or holding companies and is an often-used method for valuing small practices, family limited partnerships, and certain pass-through entities. The asset approach also is sometimes used in the  valuation of very small businesses and/or professional practices where there is little or no practice goodwill.

## Premise of Value
### Business Valuation
1. Going concern
2. Liquidation
	1. orderly
	2.  forced

### Asset Valuation
1. Fair Market value - removal
2. fair market value in continued use
3. fair market value - installation
4. orderly liquidation value
5. forced liquidation value

See addendum 3 for information on premise of value for individual assets.

Determine control of asset - does the investor have a controlling interest - can they liquidate the asset if need be?
Determine if appropriate to adjust for capital gains tax.

## Steps
1. Obtain Balance Sheet
2. Adjust Recorded Assets to Fair Market Value
	1. Tangible
	2. Intangible
Once the asset side of the balance sheet has been restated to fair market value, it is a simple process to subtract all liabilities, again at fair market value, to derive the fair market value of the equity of the business under the asset approach.

### Items
Current and Tangible Assets
1. Cash
2. Accounts Receivable
3. Prepaid Expenses
4. Inventory
	1. Cost of Reproduction Method
	2. The Comparative Sales Method
	3. Income Method
5. Fixed Assets
	1. Real Estate
	2. Machinery and Equipment
6. Recognized Intangible
	1. Those that arise from capitalized historic expenditures for services
	2. Those that represent historic payments for intangible assets, which may or may not have value at the valuation date

Liabilities
 1. Accounts Payable - no adjustment required
 2. Accrued Liabilities
 3. Interest-Bearing Debt
	 1. Short-Term
	 2. Long-Term
 4. Unrecorded Liabilities
 5. Built-In Gain
 
# Valuation Discounts and Premiums
Almost completely Qualitative. You can probably back out the discounts and premiums for presentation purposes. Not entirely reliable.

Discounts - Reduce value of interests in closely held businesses
Premiums - increase value of those interests

The most common valuation discounts and premiums arise from the basic concepts of control and marketability.
Other discounts include the discounts for dependence on a key person, a restrictive agreement, or built-in capital gains

Control premium can be extended to Synergistic (or Investment or Acquisition) Value.

## Control and Income Approach
When valuing a minority interest, it may be preferable to start work at the minority interest level rather than take on the additional work and risk of error involved in discounting back to a minority value from a control value. Conversely, when valuing a controlling interest, it may be easier to start with a control value than to add a control premium.

Applicable in valuation of Restricted Stock.
Voting vs Non-Voting Stock.

Beware Double Discounting.
Discounting is not additive nor orthogonal.
